        <title>Performance</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-quality-factor-and-piezoelectric-coupling-coefficient-important&quot;&gt;Why quality factor and piezoelectric coupling coefficient important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For applications in wireless communication such as radio frequency filter. High quality factor means more idealized shape of filter transmission curve and lower power consumption. The piezoelectric coupling coefficient directly influenced the bandwidth of the filter. Small or large coupling coefficient is needed for different purpose, however the maxim coupling coefficient a device can achieve is limited by the intrinsic properties of piezoelectric material. As to aluminum nitride, this value is around 0.06.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For applications as mass sensor, high quality factor means better signal to noise ratio and lower power consumption of the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For applications as acoustic actuator, high coupling coefficient is needed in order to achieve a higher electrical-mechanical energy conversion efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-your-device-performance-compared-to-the-device-fabricated-on-silicon-&quot;&gt;How is your device performance compared to the device fabricated on silicon ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following cited from [1], page 126, which briefly reviewed the quality factor footprint of the silicon based FBAR device fabricated in industry lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;table-wrapper&quot;&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;1993&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;1995&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;2000&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;2002&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;2006&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;2007&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Q factor&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;small&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;~500&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;~1000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;~2000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;~3000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;~3200&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that our device nearly catch up with the performance of silicon FBAR at year 2000. However, this quality factor can be further enhanced by adjusting the cavity size and the alignment of the device with the cavity. By using transfer print method, our device had great potential in achieving the performance which state-of-art FBAR can achieved on silicon, but the performance sometimes may compromise with device stability, especially on flexible substrate, so several trade-offs must be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chen-et-al-2-reported-fbar-device-directly-fabricated-on-pi-with-quality-factor-as-high-as-970-so-whats-your-advantage-over-them&quot;&gt;Chen et al [2] reported FBAR device directly fabricated on PI with quality factor as high as 970, so what’s your advantage over them?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using recommended method in Chen’s work [3] while calculating quality factor. A more simplified method was using the 3dB width method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;Q = f/\Delta f&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\Delta f&lt;/script&gt; is the 3dB width of the resonant peak in &lt;strong&gt;frequency impedance curve&lt;/strong&gt;. However, in Chen’s paper, neither impedance curve nor smith chart were showed. It seems that they are using 3db width of the scatter parameter curve while calculating the quality factor, which may yield a very confusing result. Piezoelectric coupling coefficient, as another important performance factor for FBAR, was not mentioned in their work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well compatibility with variety of substrate and fabrication process is another advantage of transfer print technique over direct-fabricate method.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flexibility</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-cant-your-device-achieve-a-better-flexibility&quot;&gt;Why can’t your device achieve a better flexibility?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aluminum nitride on the cavity cracks while bending on the 1-cm-diameter-column. Since the fracture strain of aluminum nitride is below 1%, this kind of failure is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a better flexibility while using aluminum nitride as the piezoelectric material, some special design strategy must be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-you-chose-aluminum-nitride-as-the-piezoelectric-material-since-it-is-hard-and-brittle&quot;&gt;Why do you chose Aluminum Nitride as the piezoelectric material since it is hard and brittle?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rogers.matse.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;Rogers’ research group&lt;/a&gt; inspired me the most about using traditional inorganic material as the building block of flexible electronics [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Just like silicon to semiconductor, there is a reason for Aluminum Nitride to become the dominant material in the bulk acoustic resonator industry. For example low acoustic energy loss under high frequency, low TCF(Temperature Coefficient of Frequency), stability in oxygen and moisture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, anything thin can be flexible, and by incorporating
appropriate design strategy, for example utilization of the neutral plane, use thinner substrate and coat strain isolation layer, the resulted electronic system could achieve great flexibility while the inorganic material in the system only subjected to minor strain thus undamaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I personally think that organic polymer may be the ultimate solution for future flexible electronics. But for certain application, there is still a long long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-quality-factor-q-fluctuate-significantly-while-bending&quot;&gt;Why the quality factor Q fluctuate significantly while bending?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the bending diameter versus quality factor data I presented in my poster may not reflect the real quality factor of the device very well. That is because it is hard for me to obtain a very stable electronic connection with the device because the probe was sharp and the substrate was soft so that the probe would easily cause local deformation of the electrode and even accidentally damage it. Under a high frequency region, this kind of deformation may induce extra electronic loss, which then downgrade the quality factor calculated from the test signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/probe_test.png&quot; alt=&quot;device under test&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the resonate frequency would not be influenced by this kind of electronic connection instability. We are currently working our way to develop some alternative signal retrieve method which could solve the signal instability problem and facilitate the application of this device.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transfer Print</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-transfer-print-technique&quot;&gt;What is transfer print technique?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following cited from Carlson et al [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transfer printing represents a set of techniques for deterministic assembly of micro-and nanomaterials into spatially organized, functional arrangements with two and three-dimensional layouts. Such processes provide versatile routes not only to test structures and vehicles for scientifi c studies but also to high-performance, heterogeneously integrated functional systems, including those in flexible electronics, three-dimensional and/or curvilinear optoelectronics, and bio-integrated sensing and therapeutic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/transferprint.png&quot; alt=&quot;transfer print illustration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, transfer print is like pressing stamp on your paper file, but the ink can be any format for example organic inks, inorganic silicon stripes and even complete multilayer device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer print can be used for utilizing materials which can not be growth directly on flexible substrate such as single crystal silicon and gallium nitride in a flexible electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-not-fabricating-fbar-directly-on-flexible-substrate&quot;&gt;Why not fabricating FBAR directly on flexible substrate?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deposition of high quality single crystal aluminum nitride require high temperature and crystal lattice match with the substrate, which made most of the flexible polymer substrate incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PI(Polyimide) can be used as a substrate for directly deposit zinc oxide as piezoelectric material due to its high temperature compatibility up to 300 degree [2]. However its brown color made it inappropriate for certain applications. The compatibility with other process and material used for flexible electronic fabrication may becoming a issue while pursuing a higher degree of integration.&lt;/p&gt;
