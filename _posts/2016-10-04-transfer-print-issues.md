### What is transfer print technique?

Following cited from Carlson et al [1]

> Transfer printing represents a set of techniques for deterministic assembly of micro-and nanomaterials into spatially organized, functional arrangements with two and three-dimensional layouts. Such processes provide versatile routes not only to test structures and vehicles for scientifi c studies but also to high-performance, heterogeneously integrated functional systems, including those in flexible electronics, three-dimensional and/or curvilinear optoelectronics, and bio-integrated sensing and therapeutic devices.

In short, transfer print is like pressing stamp on your paper file, but the ink can be any format for example organic inks, inorganic silicon stripes and even complete multilayer device.

Transfer print can be used for utilizing materials which can not be growth directly on flexible substrate such as single crystal silicon and gallium nitride in a flexible electronic system.

### Why not fabricating FBAR directly on flexible substrate?

The deposition of high quality single crystal aluminum nitride require high temperature and crystal lattice match with the substrate, which made most of the flexible polymer substrate incompetence.

PI(Polyimide) can be used as a substrate for directly deposit zinc oxide as piezoelectric material due to its high temperature compatibility up to 300 degree [2]. However its brown color made it inappropriate for certain applications. The compatibility with other process and material used for flexible electronic fabrication may becoming a issue while pursuing a higher degree of integration.
