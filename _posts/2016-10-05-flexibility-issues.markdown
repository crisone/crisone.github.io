###  Why can't your device achieve a better flexibility?

The aluminum nitride on the cavity cracks while bending on the 1-cm-diameter-column. Since the fracture strain of aluminum nitride is below 1%, this kind of failure is reasonable.

To achieve a better flexibility while using aluminum nitride as the piezoelectric material, some special design strategy must be used.

### Why do you chose Aluminum Nitride as the piezoelectric material since it is hard and brittle?

[Rogers' research group](http://rogers.matse.illinois.edu/) inspired me the most about using traditional inorganic material as the building block of flexible electronics [1].

First, Just like silicon to semiconductor, there is a reason for Aluminum Nitride to become the dominant material in the bulk acoustic resonator industry. For example low acoustic energy loss under high frequency, low TCF(Temperature Coefficient of Frequency), stability in oxygen and moisture.

Second, anything thin can be flexible, and by incorporating
appropriate design strategy, for example utilization of the neutral plane, use thinner substrate and coat strain isolation layer, the resulted electronic system could achieve great flexibility while the inorganic material in the system only subjected to minor strain thus undamaged.

Third, I personally think that organic polymer may be the ultimate solution for future flexible electronics. But for certain application, there is still a long long way to go.

### Why the quality factor Q fluctuate significantly while bending?
Actually, the bending diameter versus quality factor data I presented in my poster may not reflect the real quality factor of the device very well. That is because it is hard for me to obtain a very stable electronic connection with the device because the probe was sharp and the substrate was soft so that the probe would easily cause local deformation of the electrode and even accidentally damage it. Under a high frequency region, this kind of deformation may induce extra electronic loss, which then downgrade the quality factor calculated from the test signal.

However, the resonate frequency would not be influenced by this kind of electronic connection instability. We are currently working our way to develop some alternative signal retrieve method which could solve the signal instability problem and facilitate the application of this device.
